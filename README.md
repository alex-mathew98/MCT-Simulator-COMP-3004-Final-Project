Developing and Testing a MCT device simulator

The goal of this project is to develop and test a simulator for embedded software used in microcurrent biofeedback devices.
This is a non invasive medical device that delivers modulated electrical signals via an electrode through the skin to communicate with the peripheral nervous system for the purpose of therapeutic intervention.

The implementation and testing are to be in C++ using the Qt framework preferably on the COMP3004-F19 VM which has the Qt Creator IDE installed.
